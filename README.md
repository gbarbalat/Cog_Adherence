# Cog_Rehab

This study investigates the relationship between specific cognitive functions (e.g., working memory, attention) and functional rehabilitation outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia enrolled in psychosocial rehabiltitation programs.  
In particular, we will investigate the _targeted_ association between 1) working memory, attention, verbal episodic memory, social cognition complaints, and general intelligence; and 2) well-being/quality of life, self-esteem, autonomy, self-stigma, adherence to treatment, insight, and recovery.  
We will use targeted maximum likelihood estimation to measure the effect of a shift in cognitive tests (e.g. one more point in digit span).  
The study design is cross-sectional and the results will have to be interpreted with caution, i.e. non-causally.
